# Project Setup with PostgreSQL

This guide will walk you through setting up PostgreSQL for your backend, connecting the server to the database, and running migrations. Follow the steps below carefully to ensure that your project is correctly configured and ready for API development.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **[Postgres App](https://postgresapp.com/)** - A native PostgreSQL installer for macOS.
- **[Beekeeper Studio (Community Edition)](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/)** - A SQL editor to manage and interact with PostgreSQL databases.

## Setting Up PostgreSQL

1. **Install Postgres App**:
   - Download and install the Postgres App from the official website.
   - Open the Postgres App and start the PostgreSQL server.

2. **Install Beekeeper Studio (Community Edition)**:
   - Download and install Beekeeper Studio.
   - Use this tool to interact with and manage your PostgreSQL databases.

3. **Create the Database and User**:
   
   Open your PostgreSQL prompt either through the terminal or using Beekeeper Studio and execute the following SQL commands:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;

   CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';

   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydatabase TO myuser;
   ```

   Replace `mydatabase`, `myuser`, and `mypassword` with the appropriate names and credentials for your project.

4. **Exit the PostgreSQL Prompt**:
   - After creating the database and user, exit the prompt with:

     ```sql
     \q
     ```

## Connecting Your Backend to PostgreSQL

1. **Run Your Server**:
   Ensure that your server is up and running before attempting to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

2. **Configure Your Backend**:
   In your backend project, make sure that your PostgreSQL database connection is correctly set up. Use the database credentials created earlier to configure the connection.

3. **Run Migrations**:
   Migrations will create the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database. Run the migration command to ensure the database schema is properly set up:

   ```bash
   vapor run migrate  # or the equivalent command for your framework
   ```

   If the migrations are successful, the tables will be created in PostgreSQL.

4. **API Development**:
   Always ensure the above steps are completed before making API calls. You can use tools like **Postman** to verify the functionality of your APIs, or write automated tests to validate your endpoints.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Errors**:
   - If you encounter any connection errors, it likely means your backend is not connected to the PostgreSQL database.
   - Repeat the steps for creating the database and user, and verify your connection details.
   - Ensure that your PostgreSQL server is running and that the credentials in your backend configuration match those in your database.

2. **Verifying with Postman**:
   - After the server is connected to the database and the migrations are applied, you can verify your APIs using **Postman**.
   - Alternatively, you can write unit tests to ensure your backend logic works as expected.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you will have a PostgreSQL database set up, connected to your backend, and ready for API development. Always ensure the database connection is successful and the migrations are applied before proceeding with API requests.
